# thumbnailr


The codes uploaded so far :

1) yvue.py ( youtube video url extracter)

This video takes in input the csv file of channel ids and gives out the thumbnails
of the top videos for each YouTube Channel

The csv file is also added named channel_list_top_500.csv

2) scrap_sb : This code extracts the channel ids from the social blade site.
This code is not inculcated in the main code so that the choice of videos for
good thumbnails can be different and so we provide the downloaded dataset from
the same code.
